# Phantasy

The idea of Phantasy is to make it as easy as possible to write PHP in a more functional, composable style.

It's essentially broken up into two parts:

  * [Core Functions](core.md)
  * [Helpful Data Types](DataTypes/README.md)

Note: In these docs, you'll sometimes see functions included from `Phantasy\PHP`, these come from the [phantasy-php](https://github.com/mckayb/phantasy-php) package.
